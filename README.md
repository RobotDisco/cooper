# Cooper

Cooper is a memorial game, based on the 1989 game [Perestroika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perestroika_(video_game))

Basically, the goal is to make it to the piece of chicken on the other side of the petals, while avoiding falling into the water or being caught by the other creatures.

## Contributing
Since I am writing this game to process the loss of my cat, there's no guarantee that I'll be in the mood to include anyone else's contributions.

Clojure(script) and game development ae not my fort√©, so I will do my best to accept any suggestions and comments with grace.
